## Nosql vs sql

## five differences between SQL and NoSQL database

# SQL

- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Database
- SQL databases are table based databases
- SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of number of rows of data
- SQL databases have prefined schema
- SQL databases are the collection of key value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column storres which do not have standard schema definitions.

# NoSQL

- NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
- NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stories.
- NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructed data.
- NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
- NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? for complex query intesive enviroment databases
2. Give a real world example. for heavy duty transactional type applications
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? best fit for the hierarchical data storage.
4. Give a real world example. You can add few more servers easily for NoSql database
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL databases

## sql vs nosql

1. What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database? It is collection of data items with pre-defined     relationships between
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? a row-based table struture/
4. What is a ‘schema’? Is a structure of a database decribed in formal lanuage supported by the database managment system.
5. What is a NoSQL database? is database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures forund in relational databases.
6. How does it work?
7. What is inside of a Mongo database? a collection of consists of one or more related objects
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. MongoDB, due to schemaless design documents makes it extremely easy to build and enhance applications over time.
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? it doesn't have the reliability functions which relational databases have.
