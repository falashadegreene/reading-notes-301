2. Should we we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form or should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? When you need to handle mutliple controlled input elements you can add a attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name

` let value = true;
  let otherValue = false;
